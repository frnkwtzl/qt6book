# Shapes

Until now we've used the ``Rectangle`` element and controls, but for free form shapes, we have to rely on images. Using the Qt Quick Shapes module it is possible to create truly free form shapes. This makes it possible to create visualizations directly from QML in a flexible manner.

In this chapter we will look at how to use shapes, the various path elements available, how shapes can be filled in different ways, and how to combine shapes with the power of QML to smoothly animate shapes.
