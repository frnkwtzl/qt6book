# Summary

In this chapter we've a look at what the Qt Quick Shapes module has to offer. Using it we can create arbitrary shapes directly in QML, and leverage the property binding system of QML to create dynamic shapes. We've also had a look at the various path segments that can be used to build shapes from elements such as lines, arcs, and various curves. Finally, we've explored the filling options, where gradients can be used to create exciting visual effects from a path.
